Add "Edinburgh Waverley" to the end of the array = stops.push("Edinburgh Waverley")
Add "Glasgow Queen St" to the start of the array = stops.shift("Glasgow Queen St")
Add "Polmont" at the appropriate point (between "Falkirk High" and "Linlithgow") = arr.insert(3, "Polmont")
Work out the index position of "Linlithgow" = arr.fetch("Linlithgow")
Remove "Livingston" from the array using its name = stops.Remove("Livingston")
Delete "Cumbernauld" from the array by index = stops.delete("Cumbernauld")
How many stops there are in the array? = stop.count
How many ways can we return "Falkirk High" from the array? =
Reverse the positions of the stops in the array = Reverse!
Print out all the stops using a for loop = p totals
